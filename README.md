FloatingActionButton
====================
Yet another library for drawing [Material Design promoted actions](http://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/promoted-actions.html).

Credits
=======
I used [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/bohsen/android-floating-action-button) library 
by [Jerzy Chalupski](https://github.com/futuresimple) as a base for development.
As this wasn't being actively developed any longer I've decided to incorperate a 
couple of the pullrequests that was submitted to the original project.


Features
========
* Support for normal `56dp` and mini `40dp` buttons.

  ![Demo](screenshots/buttons.png)

* Customizable background colors for normal and pressed states and icon drawable.

* Convenience `AddFloatingActionButton` class with plus icon drawn in code.
* `FloatingActionsMenu` which can be expanded/collapsed to reveal multiple actions.

* Optional labels for buttons in `FloatingActionsMenu`.

Usage
=====
Just add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.conhea:floatingactionbutton:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

To see how the buttons are added to your xml layouts, check the sample project.
